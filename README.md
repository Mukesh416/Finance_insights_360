**Prioritize your projects**
Here you see list of projects a team is handling and they want to prioritize which project to take over considering the time and effort limitation with the size and impact of project.
	The interesting things we found out is there are projects we often look at and think they are easy to do but end up allocating more resources to it and wasting time on it. Also we look at the huge projects which take more time but create immediate impact which should be completed first. So the visualization dvelve into the priorities based on the scale and provide a graph which divide projects into 4 quadrants. Rest you go into the PDF and I am sure you'll love it
